*Overkill is an endless upgrade shooter with the goal to kill as many aliens as you can for as long as you can!*

This game was built for the NSCC Fall Warm Up Jam 2024 with the theme Bad Luck can be useful. I took this as gaining a bonus for every time you die.
In overkill you get a multiplier added to your rewarded upgrade points based on how far below 0hp you when when you died.
