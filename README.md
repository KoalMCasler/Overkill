*Overkill is an endless upgrade shooter with the goal of killing as many aliens as you can for as long as you can!*

This game was built for the NSCC Fall Warm Up Jam 2024 with the theme Bad Luck can be useful. 
In overkill, when you get killed you get a multiplier based on how far below 0 you went. This takes luck into account as what enemies spawn is entirely random. So you get a run with mostly weak/fast guys you might last longer but get a lower bonus. If you get mostly slow/tanky guys you won't last as long but might get a 2x bonus for that run.
